# mnistData
<h2> Simple MNIST NN.</h2>
<p> This model achieved a little over 90% accuracy (not good enough in this context) , it contains 10 neurons with one output layer ths model did not consider that we had images, only considered a long list of vectors representing an image.</p>

<h2> Deed NN MNIST.</h2>
<p> images are 28 x 28 and we can insert [Convolution NN](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/supervised/ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork/) to learn features of images by "scanning" the image through small filters. </p>
